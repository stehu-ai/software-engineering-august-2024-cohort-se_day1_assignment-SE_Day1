#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It's the systematic approach in creating solutions to problems through maintenance of software products. 
It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of life of modern life e.g communication, healthcare and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
2. The advent of structrured programming in the 1970s.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements
   One is required to gather and document user needs and system requirements. 
2. Design
   One is required to create high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation
   One is required to write code and build the software to the specifications of the design.
4. Testing
   One is required to conduct various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. 
5. Deployment
   One is required to release the software to the users or customers.
6. Maintenance
   One is required to provide ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall methodology it follows a sequence of events from top to bottom e.g the process of developing a software has to be adhered from requirements, design, implememntation, testing, deployment to maintenance while agile methodology follows the process of repeating coded instructions or designs until a specific end result is obtained through collaboration and response to change. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer
Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer
Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager
Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs
These are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA,
2. VCS
These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges
1. Changing Requirements
2. Tight Deadlines
3. Technical Debt
   Strategies for overcoming challenges
   1. Effective communication
   2. Agile methodologies
   3. Prioritization of tasks
   4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing
   It tests individual components or modules of software
2. Integration Testing
   It tests interactions between different components or subsystems
3. System Testing
   It tests the entire software as a whole
4. Acceptance Testing
   It tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the act of giving clear and concise instructions to an AI and expect to get the best response from the model.
It's important because it helps the AI to avoid giving confused or general answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Make a customer service representative 
Make a customer service representative cv tailored to the job description and cv attached herewith.

It gives the specific cv with detailed instructions as per the job role indicated.
